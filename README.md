Predicting the selling price of a residential property based on a number of factors, including the property age, availability of local amenities, and location.

I used a dataset of real estate sales transactions to predict the price-per-unit of a property based on these features. The price-per-unit in this data is based on a unit measurement of 3.3 square meters.

Several Machine Learning algorithms were used and the optimal one was chosen based on the least Root Mean Squared Error and highest R2
